            pictures while you’re away via Facebook. The dogs get to run and play for hours!! Ours comes home sleepy
            and happy every time! We also get a nice highlights overview upon pickup. 100% recommend for social doggies!”

            “We loved our experience at Canine Club House! We brought our pup, Berry, here for four nights while visiting
            family in Perry and he had a blast! We loved seeing the photos of him daily and how much fun all the dogs
            have! We could tell they treat the dogs like their own and work them out very well! 100% would recommend to
            anyone. Very fair prices, easy to make a reservation, overall a lovely business and people.”

            and activities for the dogs to do. My dogs always come back tired and the daily pictures on Facebook are a
            great way to check in on them!”

            “We have never boarded our dogs before so I was a little nervous about leaving them somewhere that wasn't home.
            They made me feel super comfortable and assured me they would be great. They take a TON of photos several times
            a day and post to Facebook so while we were on vacation I could check in and see my doggies having a great time!!
            The pricing was excellent and drop off and pick up was a breeze! I will def use them again and highly recommend!!”
